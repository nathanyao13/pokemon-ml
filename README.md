Pokémon Legendary Classifier: A Machine Learning Exploration

Pokémon has been a significant part of my life—from trading cards with classmates in elementary school to competing in TCG tournaments and playing the video games on emulators. As a longtime fan, I’ve followed this iconic Japanese franchise since childhood. However, as I’ve grown older, my interactions with Pokémon have become less frequent. Now, as a college student studying Statistics and Machine Learning at CMU, I’ve been learning various machine learning concepts through my coursework. This project is an opportunity to merge my passion for Pokémon with my knowledge of data science and machine learning by building a classifier that predicts whether a Pokémon is Legendary.

According to the Pokémon Wikipedia page, Legendary Pokémon are described as:
  “A group of incredibly rare and often very powerful Pokémon. They are often featured prominently in the legends and myths of the Pokémon world, with some even going so far as to view them as deities … No explicit criteria define what makes a Pokémon a Legendary Pokémon. Instead, the only way to identify a Pokémon as belonging to this group is through statements from official media, such as the games or animation.”

As a Pokémon fan, Legendary Pokémon have always carried an air of mystery and admiration. My goal in this project is to leverage machine learning techniques to build a classifier that can identify Legendary Pokémon based on a dataset covering all Pokémon from the first seven generations.

Project Overview

This repository includes:
- A dataset sourced from [Kaggle]([url](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rounakbanik/pokemon/data)) containing information on Pokémon stats, types, and other attributes.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover key patterns and relationships in the dataset.
- A Decision Tree Classifier to predict whether a Pokémon is Legendary.
- A Neural Network Classifier to explore a more advanced approach to classification.
